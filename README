== Installing
instructions on installing (mostly for macs)
```bash
rvm install ruby 1.8.7
rvm 1.8.7
gem install rails -v 3.1.1 # yeah yeah yeah
bundle install
rails s
```

== Common Errors
`read': No such file or directory - .. /config/juggernaut.yml (Errno::ENOENT)

you need to have this app config file in place:
ln -s $(pwd)/config/juggernaut.yml.example config/juggernaut.yml

== Deploying
gem install capistrano -v 2.8.0
set up your .ssh/config file to use the correct key/username
cap deploy
